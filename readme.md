This program is designed specifically for a Minecraft Java server mod called 'Geyser' and 'floodgate'.


How it works: you type in a Minecraft Bedrock user's gamertag, and the program will spit out the command to whitelist them on Geyser.


Usage scenario: you try to whitelist a Minecraft Bedrock user on your server and you get an error saying the server can't find the user. you then pull out this program to convert their bedrock editon XUID to a java editon UUID format, so you CAN whitelist them.
